# airbnb_price-location_analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes airbnb data for 3 major cities (Barcelona, Berlin, Paris). focusing on price trends, neighbourhood pricing, accommodation types, and correlations with reviews and minimal stay. Visualisations include price comparisons, most expensive and cheapest districts and insights into other factors influencing rental pricing.

## Objectives
- Compare average price rentals across cities
- identify most and least expensive neighbourhoods
- analyze room types and their distribution
- explore correlations between price, number of reviews, and minimum nights

## Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Data [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

## Files
- project.py main code
- README.md this file
- requirements.txt list of dependancies

## Key findings
